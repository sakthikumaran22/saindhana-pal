              It’s easy to do. Planting seeds and watching them grow is
              something anyone can do.

            <li>
              You don’t need lots of space. Having a huge garden is great, but
              you can grow all kinds of plants in pots or window boxes. Or how
              about keeping indoor plants on a windowsill?
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It looks good. Masses of colorful flowers can really brighten up
              your day and they keep bees and other insects, happy too.
            </li>
            <br />

              If your soil is muddy, give it a few days to dry out. If it’s hard
              or dusty, water it thoroughly and then wait for a few days until
              it is damp throughout.

              Next, pull out the weeds and cover your bed of soil with a layer

              Flowers add color to a garden. They smell good, too! First, decide
              what you want to plant. Some flowers need sun and others need
              shade. Find a space in your garden where your flowers will get the
              light they need.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Some flowers can be bought in pots and replanted. Others can be
              grown by yourself from seeds or bulbs. Plant hardy bulbs in the
              fall. These bulbs need cold weather to grow in the spring. Plant
              tender bulbs in the spring and watch them flower in summer.

              Annuals are the plants that need to be planted every year. They
              last for one growing season. They include Zinnia and many
              Sunflowers.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Some flowers are Perennials. They will flower for many growing
              seasons. Lilies and Tulips are perennials. They grow from bulbs.

              Did you know that many insects and birds like flowers. If you want
              to see butterflies, plant Aster and Goldenrod. Hummingbirds like
              Petunia and Zinnia. You can choose what flowers to plant based on
              color. Here are some ideas:
              <pre>
                RED = Cosmos,
                Zinnia ORANGE = Dahlia,
                Marigold YELLOW = Daffodil, 
                Sunflower GREEN = Bells of Ireland,
                Sweet Annie PURPLE = Aster, 
                Statice WHITE = Shasta Daisy, Stock

              Light is very important for the indoor plants. To get the right

              give the most light. East and West facing windows have a medium
              amount of light. North facing windows have the least light.
